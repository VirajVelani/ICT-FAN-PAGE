           <b> BCCI hails Team India’s unbeaten run to ICC Champions Trophy 2025 glory</b>
            <br>
            The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) proudly congratulates Team India on their magnificent triumph in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. India showcased their cricketing supremacy, emerging victorious in dominant fashion and reaffirming their place as the top-ranked side in both ODIs and T20Is.
            <br>
            From the very outset, the team pursued excellence, overcoming formidable challenges with a brand of cricket that was both fearless and disciplined. Their unbeaten run in an ICC tournament is a true reflection of their consistency, strategic execution, and hunger to succeed on the global stage. The final against New Zealand was the perfect culmination of this journey - an exhibition of resilience and high-pressure mastery.

            <br>
            The BCCI also lauds the role of Head Coach Gautam Gambhir, whose fearless approach and tactical insight were key to shaping this winning team. His emphasis on self-belief and strategic execution was evident in the way the players carried themselves throughout the competition.

            <br>
            Mr. Roger Binny, President, BCCI: “This triumph is a landmark moment for Indian cricket, following the high of last year’s T20 World Cup success. To dominate yet another global tournament and bring home the Champions Trophy is a phenomenal achievement. The team has played with unparalleled consistency and character, and I congratulate captain Rohit Sharma, Head Coach Gautam Gambhir, and the entire squad for their historic success.”
            <br>
